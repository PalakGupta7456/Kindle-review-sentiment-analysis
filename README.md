Inspiration
- Sentiment analysis on reviews.
- Understanding how people rate usefulness of a review/ What factors influence helpfulness of a review.
- Fake reviews/ outliers.
- Best rated product IDs, or similarity between products based on reviews alone (not the best idea ikr).
- Any other interesting analysis




 ## Kindle Review Sentiment Analysis using Word2Vec and XGBoost (Tuned)

# Project Overview

This project performs sentiment analysis on Kindle Reviews using Word2Vec embeddings and an improved XGBoost model with RandomizedSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.

# Dataset Description

Dataset: Kindle Reviews Dataset

Key Columns: reviewText (text data), overall (rating)

Sentiment Mapping: Ratings â‰¥ 4 are treated as Positive (1), otherwise Negative (0)

# Project Workflow

# 1. Data Preprocessing

âœ… Removal of special characters and numbersâœ… Conversion to lowercaseâœ… Stopword removalâœ… Lemmatization for improved word generalizationâœ… Rare word removal for noise reduction

# 2. Word2Vec Model Training

vector_size=200

window=7

min_count=3

epochs=20

# 3. Feature Extraction

Averaged Word2Vec vectors for each review are used as features.

# 4. Hyperparameter Tuning (XGBoost)

Used RandomizedSearchCV for faster optimization

Key tuned parameters:

n_estimators: [100, 200, 300]

max_depth: [3, 5, 7]

learning_rate: [0.01 â€“ 0.3]

subsample: [0.7, 0.8, 1.0]

colsample_bytree: [0.7, 0.8, 1.0]

# 5. Model Training & Evaluation

Tuned model achieved 80.4% accuracy on the test set.
